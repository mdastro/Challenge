# Challenge
My personal repo with stuff for the J-PAS SED fitting challenge.

### Codes
My codes are in the file `Coding`.

### Photometric Catalogue
The photometric catalogue (i.e. dataset) is in the folder `PhotoCatalogs` and follow the following logic:

All the dataset for a certain redshift is in files like this: `photocat_challenge_z021.csv`	(ending with `.csv` or `.fits`, I saved in both formats).
These same files separated for the J-PAS and J-PLUS filters, are under: `photocat_challenge_z021_JPAS.csv` or `photocat_challenge_z021_JPLUS.csv`  (ending with .csv` or `.fits`, I saved in both formats).
